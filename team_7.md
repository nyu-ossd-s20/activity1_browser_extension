1. The README file gives an overview of what the repo is and what it does, as well as to give instructions on how to first install it. It is also a general location to link to other important areas, such as a support page.

2. The LICENSE file specifies the permissions available to any contributor or downloader, and what (legally) they are allowed to do with the code in the repository. It needs to be in a repository if you basically want your license to be anything other than the default copyright license. In this case of an open source repo, definitely.

3. The CONTRIBUTING file gives any would-be collaborators certain guidelines and tips on how they can contribute to the project. It provides types of contributions you can make, a link to the code style guidelines, and even a support page.

4. A good contribution you can make without writing code could be translating existing strings and text into another language.

5. The CODE OF CONDUCT gives just that, a link to the code of conduct and etiquette guidelines to use when interacting with members of the community to ensure an inclusive environment online and in real life.

6. - Being disrespectful to other contributors
   - Excluding others due to descrimination against race, ethnicity, location, etc.
   - Threatening violence against someone or posting someone's personal information online
   
7. If you run into a problem, you can file a bug in their bug reporter, email their mailing list, or contact them on their IRC channel.
